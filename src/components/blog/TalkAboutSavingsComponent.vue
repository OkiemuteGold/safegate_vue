                        <p class="">Retirement does not necessary mean that you will not work for the rest of your life. In fact, most people begin a new career after retirement. The perspective from which we should wisely view retirement is financial freedom. Therefore, retirement should be when you don’t need to work to meet your basic financial need for the rest of your life. Every work you then do after retirement should be in every way pleasurable.</p>
                        <p class="">Retirement is a stage that every wise person should plan for and if you haven’t done so much on it, then you should begin now. The Pension system in Nigeria attempts to give people a reliable retirement plan. However, when you compare the statutory retirement age of 60years for public workers (according to the Pension Act) with the life expectancy rate in Nigeria which is 52/54 for male/female (World Health Organization- 2013), then it will be advisable to seek alternative pension plans that you have more control over. Life expectancy in Europe, Asia, USA and Latin America ranges between 76years and 85years with retirement age of 60- 65years.</p>
                        <p class="">Another reason you need to have an alternative retirement plan is because you are not sure of what the pension system in Nigeria will look like in 20years time. </p>
                        <h3>Five Alternative Retirement Plans </h3>
                        <p><b>1.</b> Individual Savings and Money Market Investment: This has been the easiest form of investment over the years and it is still perhaps, the best alternative to pension plan because of its liquidity and flexibility. The wisdom is to habitually set a percentage of your income aside in an individual savings account with a bank or invest in a fixed deposit account. In selecting such investment option, preservation of value is a key success factor. The investment must at least have a yield that is up to inflation rate. Inflation rate in Nigeria was recorded at 7.9% in April 2014 (National Bureau of Statistics) therefore, it is advisable to seek a savings or fixed deposit plan with interest of at least 8%. I have a mentor who has been practicing this over the years impressively- He is retired but he earns a monthly interest on his investment that can be compared with salary earned by executives in fairly big organizations. You may also consider building up your savings and fixed deposit account to such a value that can yield you your retirement salary monthly.</p>
                        <p><b>2.</b> Stock Market: Investment in stock market means you are investing in a company you don’t know or have any control over but you rely on the market system to determine your return. It is liquid and has the capacity of yielding high returns. The stock market is also volatile, this is why analysts usually advocate for long term investment in stock market (7years) rather than short to medium (2- 5years). It is advisable that you consider stock after your savings/deposit investment and use your disposable cash to invest.</p>
                        <p> <b>3.</b> Property: You can invest in property either to sell in the future or to earn rental income. Investment in property is good but can be frustrating because of its illiquidity (at times) and the ability to determine the real market value of the property. This creates a level of uncertainty even in the established property market in Nigeria. Another challenge is that investment in property requires a sizeable capital which may take time to gather in the absence of an efficient mortgage system. It is advisable to consider property investment after your savings, deposit, and stock. If you happen to make some exceptional income now, you may consider investing in property as long as your current regular income can take care of your financial needs.</p>
                        <p> <b>4.</b> Co-Invest in a business: This may sound unusual but it is a very good alternative retirement plan. It is also called joint venture investment. You can invest through a bank or invest with friends while you continue with your daily job. It can yield additional income to you and become the outfit you will retire to. It is advisable that you contact a financial adviser on how to co-invest and own the company when you retire.</p>
                        <p><b>5.</b> Start a trading business: If you have a flair for trading, you can consider starting a trading business with the aim to integrate manufacturing of your product in the future. This will give you a focus on the future. It will not hurt you to keep an eye on these alternatives.</p>
